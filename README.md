# Pablo Cirre (branvan3000)

I build production-grade pipelines and tools around company databases: extraction, enrichment, quality-control, and delivery systems.
I also ship SEO automation and PHP/Python utilities that turn messy data into usable products.

## What I work on

Company data and business intelligence
- Large-scale extraction and enrichment of company datasets (web, category, rating/reviews, geo fields, digital presence signals)
- Quality gates, deduplication strategies, normalization, and export packaging (CSV/XLSX)
- Dataset delivery systems and workflows for B2B usage

SEO engineering and automation
- Scalable content and metadata workflows
- Technical SEO utilities focused on crawlability, indexing, sitemap strategies, and international SEO

PHP and Python for real products
- PHP for plug-and-play website tooling
- Python for data processing, QA pipelines, and automation scripts

Unity prototyping
- Gameplay prototypes and technical experiments (tooling mindset applied to game dev)

## Featured projects

KaijuTranslator
A plug-and-play PHP translation layer that generates indexable, server-rendered translations under /{lang}/ (no URL rewrites),
with caching, hreflang, and sitemap index generation.
Repo: https://github.com/branvan3000/KaijuTranslator

Canibal Keyword (Keyword Cannibalization Eliminator)
Automates keyword cannibalization cleanup from Semrush/Sistrix/Ahrefs exports (CSV/XLSX) to produce a cleaner keyword plan.

## Current focus

- Turning company data workflows into repeatable, documented pipelines that other teams can run
- Publishing more plug-and-play tools (clear docs, examples, and predictable outputs)
- Making international SEO and i18n workflows simpler for PHP sites

## Collaboration

I’m open to collaborating on:
- Data quality tooling (dedupe, validation, anomaly detection, QA reports)
- SEO automation (sitemaps, hreflang, canonicals, crawl diagnostics)
- PHP utilities that can be dropped into existing sites with minimal friction
- Practical open data standards for company datasets

If you want to collaborate, open an issue in the relevant repository with:
- Goal and constraints
- Sample inputs/outputs
- Expected scale (rows, pages, languages)

## Notes on data

My work focuses on company data for commercial, research, and economic analysis use cases.
I avoid personal data and design pipelines to be auditable and maintainable.
